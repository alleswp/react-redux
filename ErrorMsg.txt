ERROR in ./client/index.js
Module build failed: Error: React Hot Loader: The Webpack loader is now exported separately. If you use Babel, we recommend that you remove "react-hot-loader" from the "loaders" section of your Webpack configuration altogether, and instead add "react-hot-loader/babel" to the "plugins" section of your .babelrc file. If you prefer not to use Babel, replace "react-hot-loader" or "react-hot" with "react-hot-loader/webpack" in the "loaders" section of your Webpack configuration.
